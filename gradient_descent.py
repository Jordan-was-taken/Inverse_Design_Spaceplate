Edits and implementation of new functions by Jordan
May 2021

This code generates a multi-layer stack bi-material spaceplate using gradient
descent, where the parameter space consists of all the layer thicknesses.

This version of the spaceplate code maximises 1/RMSE for a constant (target) R.

Say you want to create a 11-layered device. The code starts off by creating a
swarm containing num_points_in_swarm points (devices) where each device has
num_layers layers (in our case 11) of random thickness. The code starts off by
optimizing the first default_start layers of each device. Once those layers have
been optimized, the next next_layers are included in the optimisation process.
This is repeated until all of the layers have been optimized. In our example,
N_layers = 11,  default_start = 3,  next_layers = 1.
The first 3 layers will be optimised to maximise 1/RMSE as much as possible,
the first 4 (default_start + next_layers), then the first 5 (default_start +
next_layers + next_layers) and so on until the thicknesses of all 11 layers
have been optimised.

When a peak is reached, one of two things can happen:

1. If the device does not have a FOM>stage_2_threshold, it is deleted and a new
   device is created to takes its place. This device got stuck at a local maximum.

2. If the device has a FOM>stage_2_threshold, it will be sent to stage 2. Stage 2
   is the same thing as te first stage, but taking much finer steps. If the
   device's FOM makes it above saving_threshold, we save it and we're done.
   Otherwise, a new random device is created in its place and the process continues

# Not implemented:
# In the final step, two arrays containing the rounded layers of the optimized
# device are created; one that contains the layers rounded down to the nearest
# 2nm increment and one that contains the layers rounded up to the nearest 2nm
# increment. All possible combinations are created and checked and the best one
# is saved. This process can really slow down the code for not a lot of gain
# once you have more than say 20 layers.
